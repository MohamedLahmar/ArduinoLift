Prerequisites Arduino

Installation First make sure you have Node.js installed. If you are unsure if node is installed, run $ node --version within terminal/command prompt. Afterwards check if you have Yarn installed. You can do this by running $ yarn --version within terminal/command prompt.

Clone Clone this repository to your local machine and move to the new folder.

$ git clone https://github.com/MohamedLahmar/Hardwareinstallatie.git $ cd Hardwareinstallatie Setup First, globally install the latest expo-cli package

$ npm install --global expo-cli@latest or $ yarn global add expo-cli@latest Next up, install all needed dependencies within the folder

$ npm install or $ yarn install Running Finally, you can start running the application

$ npm start or $ yarn start

codesys
CODESYS, a portmanteau for controller development system, previously stylised CoDeSys) is a development environment for programming controller applications according to the international industrial standard IEC 61131-3. The main product of the software suite is the CODESYS Development System, an IEC 61131-3 tool.

The five programming languages for application programming defined in the IEC 61131-3 are available in the CODESYS development environment.

IL (instruction list) is an assembler like programming language (Is now deprecated but available for backward compatibility)
ST (structured text) is similar to programming in Pascal or C
LD (ladder diagram) enables the programmer to virtually combine relay contacts and coils
FBD (function block diagram) enables the user to rapidly program both Boolean and analogue expressions
SFC (sequential function chart) is convenient for programming sequential processes and flows
Additional graphical editor available in CODESYS:

CFC (Continuous Function Chart) is a sort of freehand FBD editor. Other than in the network-oriented FBD editor where the connections between inputs, operators and outputs are set automatically they have to be drawn by the programmer. All boxes can be placed freely which makes it possible to program feedback loops without interim variables
